An Arduino-based, Solar Tracking device that makes a Solar Panel follow the position of the Sun or other sources of light.  
The system moves the panel both vertically and horizontally, by taking analog information from 4 LDRs (all 4 cardinal directions) and converting them into digital values that are later used for servomotors' movement.
The movement logic is based on the following flowcharts:

The goal of the Dual-Axis Solar Tracking System is to increase the power output of the Solar Panel attached, in comparison with a fixed one.  
The circuit has the following structure:
