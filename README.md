A Solar Panel that moves according to the position of the Sun or other sources of light.  
The system moves the panel both vertically and horizontally.  
The movement logic is based on the following flowcharts:

The goal of the Dual-Axis Solar Tracking System is to increase the power output of the Solar Panel attached, in comparison with a fixed one.  
The circuit has the following structure:
